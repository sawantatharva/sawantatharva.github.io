				<h3 class="p3">Curriculum Vitae (CV)</h3>
				<p>In Summer 2022, I was supposed to intern as an EEG (Electroencephalogram) Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.stimveda.com/">StimVeda Neurosciences</a>, but instead, I decided to work on an idea (As of August 2022, in Stealth) that I'm extremely passionate about.</p>
				<p>I was born in Mumbai, India, but spent most of my childhood in a small town between the Western Ghats and Coastal Region of India called Khed before moving to Pune, India, to finish my last two years of high school. As a result, I got both experiences of growing up in the countryside and a metropolis, ended up trilingual and can speak English, Hindi, and Marathi fluently. In my free time, you can find me reading random Wikipedia pages or hunting down new Sahil Bloom chatters with lots of Butter Chicken & Roti on the side.</p>
