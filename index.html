				<p>Hi, I am an undergraduate student at Plaksha University, where I am planning to major in Biological Systems Engineering (coursework <a href="coursework.html">here</a>). Originally from Pune, India, I am fascinated by incredible breakthroughs in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, International Relations, and Venture Capital.</p>
				<p>In Summer 2022, I was supposed to intern as an EEG (Electroencephalogram) Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.stimveda.com/">StimVeda Neurosciences</a>, but instead, I decided to work on an idea (As of August 2022, in Stealth) that I'm extremely passionate about.</p>
				<p>Past is an amazing place to ponder, find out about some cool things I accomplished in the past <a href="cv.html">here</a>.</p>
